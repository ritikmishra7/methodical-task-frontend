# Task-Wise

Task-Wise is a real-time project-based task management application that simplifies task management and collaboration within teams. The application allows users to create tasks, add subtasks, upload attachment files, and engage in project-based chat room discussions, all in one centralized platform.

## Features

- **Task Creation**: Easily create tasks with detailed descriptions, due dates, priorities, and assign them to team members.
- **Subtask Management**: Break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks, assign them to different team members, and track their progress individually.
- **Attachment Upload**: Attach relevant files, documents, or images to tasks or subtasks, ensuring all essential information is in one place.
- **Project Chat Room**: Engage in real-time discussions and collaborate effectively with your team members within dedicated project-based chat rooms.
- **User Management**: Invite team members to join projects, assign roles and permissions, and manage user access to ensure effective collaboration.

## Installation

To run Task-Wise locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
